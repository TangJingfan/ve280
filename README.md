## Introduction 

This is the repo for VE280 (Programming & Elem Data Structure). The repo includes seven coding exercises and five projects.

## Compile and Run
This course is based on shell and c++. For exercise and projects in different languages, we need different compile command.

- For shell,
```shell
chmod +x script.sh
```

- For c++.
```shell
make
```

## Description
- Exercise 1
    A simple shell script to move files, rename them, and create directory.
- Project 1
    A simple number property checker based on `loop` and `if ()`. p1 would check whether the input number has some special properties.
- Exercise 2
    A library management system based on `struct`.
- Exercise 3
    A terminal script that can encode a sentence and decode them, which will take argument `int argc` and `char* argv[]` from terminal. 
- Project 3
    A eco-system simulation. The behaviours of different species are realized.
